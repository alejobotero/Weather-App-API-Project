How to start server, 
1. cd to appropriate file path
2. Make sure  "type": "module", is written in package.json. 
3. Type 'node server.mjs' in terminal and that should start the server on port 3000

Also make sure the node_modules folder is in the same directory. This is so express, axiom and ejs work.
Used npm i to install ejs express and axios.
